### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Junlong "Aaron" Zhou, a Ph.D. student in Political Economy from NYU. 

I work on positive political economy and political methodology (you may call it applied statistics, or econometrics in your field). You may find some of my research [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LadSnrMAAAAJ).

I don't (publicly) work on github. Feel free to check [my website](https://www.zhoujunlong.com/).
