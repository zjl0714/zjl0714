### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Junlong "Aaron" Zhou, a Staff Data Scientist at Tencent America. 

Prior to Tencent Americas, I did my Ph.D. studies in Political Economy at New York University.

I work on experimentation and causal inference. I also conduct academic research on positive political economy and political methodology (you may call it applied statistics, or econometrics in your field). You may find some of my research [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LadSnrMAAAAJ).

Recently, me and a diverse team of scholars from both political science and computer science have launched **political-LLM program**, aiming to give a **comprehensive survey on LLM application in political science and its potential direction of development**. For more details, you can check our website at [https://political-llm.org/](http://political-llm.org)

You may also find some of my teaching material in pinned repositories. 

I don't (publicly) work on github. Feel free to check [my website](https://www.zhoujunlong.com/).
